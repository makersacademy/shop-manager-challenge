# Shop Manager Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

## 2. Design the Class System

_Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to
focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below
uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com_

![Alt text](/recipe/shop_manager_app_design.png?raw=true "Optional Title")


_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._

```ruby
class Application

  def initialize(database_name, io, item_repository, order_repository)
    DatabaseConnection.connect(database_name)
    @io = io
    @item_repository = item_repository
    @order_repository = order_repository
  end

  def run
    

  end
end

if __FILE__ == $0
  app = Application.new(
    'shop_manager',
    Kernel,
    ItemRepository.new,
    OrderRepository.new
  )
  app.run
end
```

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and
combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# 1 Puts interactive menu

    puts "Welcome to the shop management program!"
    puts "What do you want to do?"
    puts "  1 = list all shop items"
    puts "  2 = create a new item"
    puts "  3 = list all orders"
    puts "  4 = create a new order"


# 2  Puts interactive menu and puts all items when 1 input

    puts "Welcome to the shop management program!"

## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
a more granular level of detail._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# Constructs a track
track = Track.new("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track.title # => "Carte Blanche"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 5. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green,
refactor to implement the behaviour._
