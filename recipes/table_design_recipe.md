# Design Recipe Template

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
As a shop manager
So I can know which items I have in stock
I want to keep a list of my shop items with their name and unit price.

As a shop manager
So I can know which items I have in stock
I want to know which quantity (a number) I have for each item.

As a shop manager
So I can manage items
I want to be able to create a new item.

As a shop manager
So I can know which orders were made
I want to keep a list of orders with their customer name.

As a shop manager
So I can know which orders were made
I want to assign each order to their corresponding item.

As a shop manager
So I can know which orders were made
I want to know on which date an order was placed.

As a shop manager
So I can manage orders
I want to be able to create a new order.
```

```
Nouns:

shop items, name, price, quantity
orders, customer name, items, placed_date
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record     | Properties                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| shop items | name, price, puantity      |
| orders     | customer_name, placed_date |

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `posts`

   Column names: `title`, `content`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `tags`

   Column names: `name`

## 3. Decide the column types.

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

Table: posts
id: SERIAL
title: text
content: text

Table: tags
id: SERIAL
name: text
```

## 4. Design the Many-to-Many relationship

Make sure you can answer YES to these two questions:

1. Can one [TABLE ONE] have many [TABLE TWO]? (Yes/No)
2. Can one [TABLE TWO] have many [TABLE ONE]? (Yes/No)

```
# EXAMPLE

1. Can one tag have many posts? YES
2. Can one post have many tags? YES
```

_If you would answer "No" to one of these questions, you'll probably have to implement a One-to-Many relationship, which is simpler. Use the relevant design recipe in that case._

## 5. Design the Join Table

The join table usually contains two columns, which are two foreign keys, each one linking to a record in the two other tables.

The naming convention is `table1_table2`.

```
# EXAMPLE

Join table for tables: posts and tags
Join table name: posts_tags
Columns: post_id, tag_id
```

## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: posts_tags.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

-- Create the first table.
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  content text
);

-- Create the second table.
CREATE TABLE tags (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name text
);

-- Create the join table.
CREATE TABLE posts_tags (
  post_id int,
  tag_id int,
  constraint fk_post foreign key(post_id) references posts(id) on delete cascade,
  constraint fk_tag foreign key(tag_id) references tags(id) on delete cascade,
  PRIMARY KEY (post_id, tag_id)
);

```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < posts_tags.sql
```
