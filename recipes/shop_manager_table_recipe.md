# Two Tables (Many-to-Many) Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables having a Many-to-Many relationship._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
As a shop manager
So I can know which items I have in stock
I want to keep a list of my shop items with their name and unit price.

As a shop manager
So I can know which items I have in stock
I want to know which quantity (a number) I have for each item.

As a shop manager
So I can manage items
I want to be able to create a new item.

As a shop manager
So I can know which orders were made
I want to keep a list of orders with their customer name.

As a shop manager
So I can know which orders were made
I want to assign each order to their corresponding items.

As a shop manager
So I can know which orders were made
I want to know on which date an order was placed. 

As a shop manager
So I can manage orders
I want to be able to create a new order.
```

```
Nouns:
item, item_name, unit_price, quantity, order, customer_name, order_date

```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| item                  | item_name, unit_price, quantity
| order                 | customer_name, order_date

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `items` 

    Column names: `item_name`, `unit_price`, `quantity`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `orders` 

    Column names: `customer_name`, `order_date`

## 3. Decide the column types.

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

Table: items
id: SERIAL
item_name: text
unit_price: int
quantity: int

Table: orders
id: SERIAL
customer_name: text
order_date: text

```

## 4. Design the Many-to-Many relationship

```

1. Can one item have many orders? YES
2. Can one order have many items? YES
```

## 5. Design the Join Table

The join table usually contains two columns, which are two foreign keys, each one linking to a record in the two other tables.

```

Join table for tables: items and orders
Join table name: items_orders
Columns: item_id, order_id, order_quantity
```

## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: items_orders.sql

CREATE TABLE items (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  item_name text,
  unit_price int,
  quantity int
);

-- Create the second table.
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name text,
  order_date text
);

-- Create the join table.
CREATE TABLE items_orders (
  item_id int,
  order_id int,
  order_quantity int,
  constraint fk_item foreign key(item_id) references items(id) on delete cascade,
  constraint fk_order foreign key(order_id) references orders(id) on delete cascade,
  PRIMARY KEY (item_id, order_id)
);

```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 shop_manager < ./seeds/shop_manager.sql
```
