# {{Application}} Class Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

> As a shop manager
> So I can know which items I have in stock
> I want to keep a list of my shop items with their name and unit price.

> As a shop manager
> So I can know which items I have in stock
> I want to know which quantity (a number) I have for each item.

> As a shop manager
> So I can manage items
> I want to be able to create a new item.

> As a shop manager
> So I can know which orders were made
> I want to keep a list of orders with their customer name.

> As a shop manager
> So I can know which orders were made
> I want to assign each order to their corresponding item.

> As a shop manager
> So I can know which orders were made
> I want to know on which date an order was placed. 

> As a shop manager
> So I can manage orders
> I want to be able to create a new order.
## 2. Design the Class Interface

_Include the initializer and public methods with all parameters and return values._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

class Application

  # The Application class initializer
  # takes four arguments:
  #  * The database name to call `DatabaseConnection.connect`
  #  * the Kernel object as `io` (so we can mock the IO in our tests)
  #  * the ItemRepository object (or a double of it)
  #  * the OrdertRepository object (or a double of it)
  def initialize(database_name, io, item_repository, order_repository)
    DatabaseConnection.connect(database_name)
    @io = io
    @item_repository = item_repository
    @order_repository = order_repository
  end

  def run
    # "Runs" the terminal application
    # so it can ask the user to enter some input
    # and then decide to run the appropriate action
    # or behaviour.

    # Use `@io.puts` or `@io.gets` to
    # write output and ask for user input.
  end

  def list_all_items

  end

  def add_new_item

  end

  def list_all_orders

  end

  def add_new_order

  end
end

# Don't worry too much about this if statement. It is basically saying "only
# run the following code if this is the main file being run, instead of having
# been required or loaded by another file.
# If you want to learn more about __FILE__ and $0, see here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Variables_and_Constants#Pre-defined_Variables
if __FILE__ == $0
  app = Application.new(
    'shop_manager',
    Kernel,
    ItemRepository.new,
    OrderRepository.new
  )
  app.run
end
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

#

```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
