# Shop Manager


This is my submission for the 'Shop-Manager' project. Set by Makers Academy as part of the module on databases. The module intents to cover the following learning objectives:
- Design a database schema with at least two tables from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL.
- Use SQL to query a database to read data from one table or results of a join, create new records, update and delete.
- Integrate a relational database to a program by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.


My application allows users to list, create, and manage items and orders. It uses a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data, and Ruby as the programming language. The program consists of an Application class that interacts with the user through a command-line interface, an Items class that represents shop items, and an Orders class that represents shop orders. The ItemsRepository and OrdersRepository classes are used to store and retrieve data from the database.
## Message to Coaches
ðŸ‘‹. Thanks for reviewing! A few things to note about this project.


### Things I am proud of and happy with:
* The program is simple and works well.
* The testing is thorough, and I'm quite proud of how thorough my use of mocking in the tests is.
* Consistent commits throughout the project, but perhaps they're a bit large towards the end.




### Things I could have done better:
* Better error handling - currently the error handling is non-existent, I will go back and revisit this when I have a moment.
* Some of the methods are a bit long and could probably be refactored, again, I will revisit this when I can.


Overall, happy with this project, it was quite straightforward and starting to get the hang of TDD.

### Notes on how to make this better when I get some spare time.


1. Add full CRUD functionality (update & delete)
2. Add in error handling
3. Refactor some of the longer methods, consider using private methods.
