# Shop Manager Challenge

This is a Ruby-based program to manage a shop's database, which is the 2nd solo project from Makers coding bootcamp.

**Demo**

```
Welcome to the shop management program!

What do you want to do?
  1 = list all shop items
  2 = create a new item
  3 = update an item's price
  4 = update stock of an item

Here's a list of all shop items:

  1. Super Shark Vacuum Cleaner - Unit price: 99 - Quantity: 30
  2. Makerspresso Coffee Machine - Unit price: 69 - Quantity: 15

Do you want to continue the programme? (y/n)

## üìù Phase 1: Requirements & Planning

### User Stories

These are given by Makers as a starting point of the challenge. Instruction details can be viewed from [this doc](doc/instructions.md).

### üéØ Goals

Here are the goals I'd like to achieve about this project:

- A well-structured interactive terminal interface
- Order can handle multiple items instead of just one
- 95%+ test coverage (by using `RSpec`)
- Making good documentation of the programme

---

### Database Diagram

Database planning is the key of this project as every class design will be based on this.

A joint table `orders_items` is served as a bridge between `items` and `orders` tables to maintain the many-to-many relationship.

**Seeds**

All the seeds that were used for testing are put inside [this folder](seeds).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: Class & Test design

### Classes

All class deisgns can be viewed in [this doc](doc/class-design.md).

### Tests

All test designs can be viewed in [this doc](doc/test-deisgn.md).

## üéâ Phase 3: Getting Started

> Before running any commands, please make sure `Ruby` has been installed in your local environment. Otherwise, please follow the instructions on [Ruby offical website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

### Install gems

`Gemfile` is ready in this project. Details of each gem can be found [here](Gemfile). Just run the following command and everything you need to run this programme will be installed.

```
bundle
```

### Run tests

`RSpec` is the testing library of this programmer. Runing the following commands to run the test(s).

```sh
# run all tests
rspec

# run a single test
rspec spec/{FILE NAME}_spec.rb
```

A coverage report will be automatically generated under `./coverage` in HTML format.

### Start the programme

Open `app.rb` and scroll to the bottom. You have to uncomment the following codes and run `ruby app.rb` in terminal.

```ruby

# The lines below will be executed only while running 'ruby app.rb'
if __FILE__ == $0
  app = Application.new(
    "shop_manager",
    Kernel,
    OrderRepository.new,
    ItemRepository.new
  )
  app.run
end

```
