User stories:

Here's an example of the terminal output your program should generate (yours might be slightly different â€” that's totally OK):

```
Welcome to the shop management program!

What do you want to do?
  1 = list all shop items
  2 = create a new item
  3 = list all orders
  4 = create a new order

1 [enter]

Here's a list of all shop items:

 #1 Super Shark Vacuum Cleaner - Unit price: 99 - Quantity: 30
 #2 Makerspresso Coffee Machine - Unit price: 69 - Quantity: 15
 (...)
```
To run the application asit is intended to be used, comment out the break in the run method in app.rb. Then run appp.rb.

## Project Description

This challenges purpose was:
*To practice test driven development
*Use doubles for testing
*Use postgreSQL for data bases (including many-to-many mappings)
*Practice object oriented programing.  
  
This application allows a user to:
> List all items in stock, including quantities and unit prices 
> Create new items to be added to the stock list, which also updates the database
> List all previous orders, including customer name, item(s) purchased, date of purchase
> Create a new order, including quantity required, which updates the database.
> It also doesn't allow an order to be created if stock is too low
