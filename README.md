Week 3 Solo Project
=================

## Shop Manager
For this week's I wrote a small terminal program allowing the user to manage a shop database containing some items and orders.
I integrated a database by using the PG gem, and test-drove and built Repository classes.
As the application requires input, I mocked IO for integration tests.

## Further Considerations
* Could have a many to many database relationship.
* Interactive menu app and test code could be condensed by factoring blocks of text.
