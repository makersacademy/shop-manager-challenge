# app = Application.new('shop_challenge_test', Kernel, OrderRepository.new, ShopItemRepository.new)
# app.run

# Functionality:

# - Can view all shop items - see each id, name, price, quantity 
# - Can create a new shop item - shop manager gets to input the name, price and quantity 
# - Can view all orders - see each id, customer name, date order was placed and 
# all of the items that are in each order (e.g. sandwich x3, crisps x2)and this will only 
# show valid orders - i.e. orders with items in them.
# - Can create new orders - shop manager can input the name of the customer and the date it was placed, 
# then the shop manager can add the items to the order and the quantity of that item added to the order 
# (third column in joins table handles this). If the item is out of stock or not in the database then 
# errors are raised. 
# If the item is successfully added to the order then a record is put in the joins table 
# to associate that order with that item and also the stock of the item goes down 
# by the number of items added to that order, so if 10 bananas in stock and 4 were 
# added to the order, the quantity number for bananas in the db would decrease to 6. 
# An error would be raised if you inputted 11 or more as you cant add more to an order than is in stock.
# Coverage at 98.75%

# Things missing / to change:

# - Haven't rspec tested the raising of the error if item is out of stock or when
# not enough stock to fulfil order, although both work - will speak to coaches
# about rspec testing user inputs that would raise an error
