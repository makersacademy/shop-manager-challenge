  #  * the AlbumRepository object (or a double of it)
  #  * the ArtistRepository object (or a double of it)

    # so it can ask the user to enter some input
    # and then decide to run the appropriate action
    # or behaviour.

    # Use `@io.puts` or `@io.gets` to
    # write output and ask for user input.
