# Two Tables (Many-to-Many) Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables having a Many-to-Many relationship._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
As a shop manager
So I can know which items I have in stock
I want to keep a list of my shop items with their name and unit price.

As a shop manager
So I can know which items I have in stock
I want to know which quantity (a number) I have for each item.

As a shop manager
So I can manage items
I want to be able to create a new item.

As a shop manager
So I can know which orders were made
I want to keep a list of orders with their customer name.

As a shop manager
So I can know which orders were made
I want to assign each order to their corresponding item.

As a shop manager
So I can know which orders were made
I want to know on which date an order was placed. 

As a shop manager
So I can manage orders
I want to be able to create a new order.
```

```
Nouns:

item_name, name, unit_price, quantity

order, customer_name, item, date
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| items                 | item_name, unit_price, quantity
| orders                  | customer_name, item, date

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `items` 

    Column names: `item_name`, `unit_price`, `quantity`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `orders` 

    Column names: `customer_name`, `item`, `date`

## 3. Decide the column types.

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```

Table: items
id: SERIAL
item_name: text
unit_price: float
quantity: int

Table: orders
id: SERIAL
customer_name: text
item: text
date: date
```

## 4. Design the Many-to-Many relationship

Make sure you can answer YES to these two questions:

1. Can one items have many orders? (Yes/No) Yes, sort of.
2. Can one orders have many items? (Yes/No) Yes

```
# EXAMPLE

1. Can one tag have many posts? YES
2. Can one post have many tags? YES
```

_If you would answer "No" to one of these questions, you'll probably have to implement a One-to-Many relationship, which is simpler. Use the relevant design recipe in that case._

## 5. Design the Join Table

The join table usually contains two columns, which are two foreign keys, each one linking to a record in the two other tables.

The naming convention is `table1_table2`.

```
Join table for tables: items and orders
Join table name: items_orders
Columns: item_id, order_id
```

## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql
-- file: items_orders.sql

-- Create the first table.
CREATE TABLE items (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  item_name text,
  unit_price float,
  quantity int
);

-- Create the second table.
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name text
  item text
  date date
);

-- Create the join table.
CREATE TABLE items_orders (
  item_id int,
  order_id int,
  constraint fk_item foreign key(item_id) references items(id) on delete cascade,
  constraint fk_order foreign key(order_id) references orders(id) on delete cascade,
  PRIMARY KEY (item_id, order_id)
);

```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 shop_manager_challenge < items_orders.sql
```
