# Shop Manager - Database Tables Design

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```

```
Nouns:

items: name, price
stock: quantity
order: customer name, item, date
customer: name
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns


| Record (Table)        | Properties                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| items                 | name, price, stock_qty      |
| orders                | customer, item, date     |

1. Table 1 name: `items` 

    Column names: `name`, `price`, `stock_qty`

2. Table 2 name: `orders` 

    Column names: `customer`, `item`, `date`

## 3. Decide the column types.

```
# EXAMPLE:

Table: items
id: SERIAL
name: text
price: int
stock_qty: int

Table: orders
id: SERIAL
customer: text
item: text
date: date
```

## 4. Design the Many-to-Many relationship

```
1. Can one order have many items? YES
2. Can one item have many orders? YES
```

## 5. Design the Join Table

```
Join table for tables: items and orders
Join table name: items_orders
Columns: item_id, order_id
```

## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql

CREATE TABLE items (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name text,
  price int,
  stock_qty int
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer text,
  item text,
  date date
);

CREATE TABLE items_orders (
  item_id int,
  order_id int,
  constraint fk_item foreign key(item_id) references items(id) on delete cascade,
  constraint fk_order foreign key(order_id) references orders(id) on delete cascade,
  PRIMARY KEY (item_id, order_id)
);

```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 shop_manager_test < items_orders.sql
```
