| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| items                 | name, price, content
| orders                | customer, date



## 3. Column types.

```

Table: items
id: SERIAL
name: text
price: float
dat: date

Table: orders
id: SERIAL
customer: text
date: date
```

## 4. Tables Relationship


1. **[order] has many [items]**
2. In that case, the foreign key is in the table [items]


## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql
-- file: order_table.sql


CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer TEXT,
  date DATE
  item_id INT,
  constraint fk_item foreign key(item_id)
    references items(id)
    on delete cascade
);

-- Then the table with the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE items (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  price FLOAT,
  quantity INT,
);

```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 shop_manager < orders_table.sql
```
