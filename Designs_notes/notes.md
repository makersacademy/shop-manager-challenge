### To Add

* Dynamic stock management (quantity is depleted when item is ordered, not allowing out of stock items to be ordered)
* Allowing orders with multiple items to be created 
* Error handling 
* More scalable order creation function - currently displays item menu to users and asks for ID - as shop grows this will lead to a poor UX
* Add Update, and Delete functions 
* displaying total cost of an order
